# Mastering Web 3.0 : BitCoin mining Simulation
`Main Goal`:- Simulate the mining process of a block by validating and including transactions from a given set of JSON files in the `mempool` folder.

So.....Let's understand the implementation behind my simulation :)
`mempool` is a temporary storage that contains all the transactions. New transactions are stored in a node's memory pool while they're waiting to get mined on to the blockchain. We use `mempool` to sort out conflicting transactions.
